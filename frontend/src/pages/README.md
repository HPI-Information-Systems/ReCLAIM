The pages directory creates the different kinds of pages on the platform.

`_app.tsx` contains page settings, that should apply to all pages, like, e.g., the footer or the font.

`index.tsx` is the landing page.

`search.tsx` contains the search results.

The subdirectories `collection`, `culturalAsset`, and `person` contain `[id].tsx` pages, which create the detail pages for these entity types.
