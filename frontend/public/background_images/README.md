This folder contains images, that are displayed as background images on the landing page. Their names indicate their Linz-Nr.

## Why are there only Images from the Linz Collection?
Out of the data sources integrated into this platform, the website for the Linz Collection (https://www.dhm.de/datenbank/linzdb/) shows the best and most easily accessible images of the cultural assets themselves. Only selecting images from the Linz Collection was, therefore, a pragmatic decision.

## On what Basis were the Images Selected?
We figured out that sepia images had, in general, a higher resolution than black-and-white images (which again had a higher resolution than the colorful images).
The following important feature is that the image is in a landscape format, which, e.g., excludes most portraits.
Using these criteria as a foundation, we then applied a subjective lens. We selected images that we found aesthetically pleasing, and that ideally conveyed a sense of dynamism.

## Editing the Images
Many images have borders, which does not look nice on the landing page. Therefore, we cropped the images to be in a 2:5 format, without borders, and focused on the 'best part' of the artwork.
